AIM:

To make the Internal LED of the Arduino to go ON for 1 second and go OFF for 1 second in an non-ending loop

COURSE OF ACTION:

The Internal LED of the Arduino is connected with the digital pin 13.
Create a loop to make the Digital Pin 13 to go HIGH, then followed by a delay of 1000 milliseconds.
After the delay make Digital Pin to go LOW, then followed by a delay of 1000 milliseconds.
